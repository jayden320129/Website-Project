        Learning to code can be difficult, but if you start off easy, the rest will become a bit easier.
        This is one of the reasons that I decided to learn HTML about a year ago.
        I dropped learning it, though, and I had to re learn everything. 
        This blog is made with the HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I have learned since then. </p>
